# TranslAItor
## Let's Bridge the Gap Between Sign-Language and Verbal Languages

The translAItor app is an innovative web-based platform designed to bridge communication gaps by translating sign language into spoken language in real time. Users can access the app through a web browser, where they can use their webcam to input sign language gestures, with a translation of their gestures being outputed in real-time via text as well as speech in a language of their choosing.

## Non-Technical Requirements

- User Experience (UX) Design:
    - An intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, designed with accessibility in mind to accommodate diverse users, including those with disabilities.
    - UI  should be simple in terms of only core functionality should be exposed to user
- Scalability:
    - The system should be scalable to handle varying loads of users and data processing needs without degradation in performance.
- Extendability:
    - Multiple sign languages should be supported and recognized as well as translation to multiple verbal languages should be supported as well
- Documentation:
    - Comprehensive documentation covering how to use the site, API documentation for future developers, and system architecture explanations.
- Training and Support:
    - User training materials, FAQs, and support mechanisms to help users understand how to use the website effectively.
    - Developer support for future modifications and troubleshooting.
- Testing and Quality Assurance:
    - Plans for rigorous testing including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests to ensure reliability and effectiveness of the website.
- Ethical Considerations:
    - Guidelines and policies to manage ethical concerns, particularly related to AI and biometric data usage.
- Compliance and Legal:
    - Compliance with data protection laws such as GDPR for handling personal data, and possibly HIPAA if considered necessary.
    - Compliance with web accessibility standards to ensure the site is usable by people with various disabilities.

## Technical Requirements

- Webcam Access:
    - Ability to access and control the userâ€™s webcam through the browser for real-time video capture.
- Real-time Video Processing:
    - Capabilities to process video input in real time to detect and interpret sign language gestures.
- Sign Language Recognition Model:
    - A machine learning model capable of recognizing and interpreting various sign language gestures from video input.
    - The model will run server-side (using TensorFlow or PyTorch with Python).
- Backend Server:
    - A robust backend using FASTAPI capable of handling requests, integrating with the AI model, and managing data flow.
- Speech Synthesis:
    - Integration of text-to-speech technology to convert the interpreted text into audible speech, possibly using Web Speech API or other libraries.
- Frontend Development:
    - A responsive and accessible user interface built with React.js that provides real-time feedback and interactive elements for users.
- APIs for Communication:
    - REST API or WebSocket API for smooth communication between the frontend and the backend, particularly for transmitting video frames and receiving processed data.
- Database Management:
    - (Optional) A database to log user sessions, store historical data, or manage user accounts, if needed.
- Security Measures:
    - (Optional) Implementations to ensure data privacy and security, including secure data transmission and storage, and compliance with relevant regulations.
